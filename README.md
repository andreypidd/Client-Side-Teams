## **Client-Side-Teams**

A fully client-side Minecraft mod for team chats with no server-side mods or plugins needed. Super handy for chatting with your team on vanilla servers!

## **Having issues?**

Please let me know in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/andreypidd/Client-Side-Teams/issues). The mod is still in development, so things might break.

## **Got a suggestion?**

Please share it in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/andreypidd/Client-Side-Teams/issues). Iâ€™m open to ideas and feedback!
